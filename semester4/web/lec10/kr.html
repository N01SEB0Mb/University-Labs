            Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person shooter game,
            in which players utilize many different operators from the Rainbow team.
            Different operators have different nationalities, weapons, and gadgets.
            The game features an asymmetrical structure whereby the teams
            are not always balanced in their choices of abilities.

                The game features a heavy emphasis on environmental destruction using a procedural destruction system.
                Players can break structures by planting explosives on them, or shoot walls to make bullet holes.
                Players may gain tactical advantages through environmental destruction,
                and the system aims at encouraging players to utilize creativity and strategy.

              <p class="fact-text">
                Maps in the game are designed to encourage close quarters combat,
                and players cannot respawn until the end of a round.
                Vertical space is a key gameplay element in the game's maps:
                players can destroy ceilings and floors using breach charges and can
                ambush enemies by rappelling through windows.

                The game features an asymmetrical structure whereby the teams are not always balanced in their
                choices of abilities. The base Counter-Terrorism Units (CTUs) available for play are the American
                Hostage Rescue Team (referred to in-game as the FBI SWAT), the British SAS, the German GSG-9,
                the Russian Spetsnaz and the French GIGN,
                each of which has four operators per unit split between attackers and defenders

                Ubisoft also envisioned the game as an esports game. The company had their first meeting
                with David Hiltscher, vice president of ESL, in late 2013. ESL offered feedback on the game's
                balancing and helped the developer to ensure that the game was suitable for competitive play.
